The ratio of 110 is 11, so the ratio of 60 and 90 (11 from 11) is 11.\n\n10 years later should be 11 years from 110, and 162-10 is 110. Therefore, the sum of their ages is $7 \\* 110 - 10 \\* 10 = 110 - 10$.\n\nTherefore, the current age is 110 + 10 = 110 - 10 = 110 - 20 = 100.\n\nWe now have to find 90 because age is 70 \\* 110 + 60 = 110 \\* 11 + 60 = 110\n\nAnd the sum of the age is 100 \\* 11 + 110 = 110\n\nTherefore, at the last exercise, he will find the total age of 110 and you can make 90.\n\nNow, let us find the ratio between 21 and the total age 110:\n\nNow subtract 11, which is 110, so that we find 210 - 110 = 110.\n\nYou have 5 years, so you can subtract 110 and the year that ages 70 \\* 11 = 210.\n\nSimplify 60 (110 \\* 110): 70 + 40 = 20.\n\nNow, we are using the ratio 41 + 110 and 11 = 110. So, if the sum of 110, you'll find 110, which is 51.\n\nNow, we subtract 51 from 110, which gives 110, which gives you 110 = 110\n\nTherefore, 210 is the ratio of 110, which means their ages will be 110: 110 / 11 = 76\n\nSo, if you find 76, double the sum of 810, i.e., 81, 210, which is 101, so the sum of the ages must be 11.\n\nSum of 61 times 6.\n\nNow, we can add 110 - 11, which is 61, which is 11.\n\nSo, the sum of 110 is the sum of 11, which means you find Allen's current age.\n\nin 110, which ration 110 = 11, so you can find Allen's age 111 = 110 \\* 210 \\* 61 = 110 \\* 71, which is 91 \\* 70 = 11,0.\n\nTherefore, the amount of 11 years is 110, which means their ages is 110, which is 1110, which means their age is 110 \\* 31 = 110 \\* 12 = 110 \\* 21 = 1,010.\n\nW, so you know the current age of Allen, or Dav, so their ages must be 110 \\* 110 = 81, which is 110, which is 41, which means their age difference is 11 plus 41 = 110.\n\nSo, the sum of 110, which is 110, which is their age, which means their age is 110, which is 110, which is the sum of the ages + 11 + 110, which is less than the difference between their ages, which is 21.\n\nTwo years later, after 110,"], "idxs": [170], "new_tokens": [997], "wall_time": [13.966838359832764]}], "tstamp": 1734604110.6098971}
