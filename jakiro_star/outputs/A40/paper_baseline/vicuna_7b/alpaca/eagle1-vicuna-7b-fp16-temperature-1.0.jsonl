Initialize variables:\n```vbnet\nv - array of integers [1..n^2]\nc - list of integers\ncount - integer\n```\n2. For each row of the grid:\n```python\nFor i = 1 to n\n   pick the middle element among the min(i, n) elements\n   append the picked element to c\n```\n3. For each non-empty connected component in the bottom-right triangle of the grid:\n```python\nWhile the set of elements in c has less than or equal to 3 elements\n   if the number of cells in the component [excluding the bottom-left triangle] is even:\n      increment count by 2\n      add the last element of c to v\n      remove the last element of c from c\n   else:\n      sort the elements in c\n      recursively merge pairs of sorted elements until there are 3 elements\n      add the smallest element among the merged sorted elements to v\n   add the leftmost value of the component to c\n```\n4. Return v.\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation:\n\n1. We initialize an array `v` of integers from 1 to `n^2`, which will represent the three-dimensional grid. We also initialize an empty list `c` to store the integers that we've found, and a variable `count` to keep track of how many connected components we've merged.\n2. We loop over each row of the grid, starting from the bottom-right triangle. For each row, we pick the middle element among the minimum of the row index and `n`, and append it to the `c` list. This ensures that we capture all connected components that are in `n` diagonal steps from a row with 0 element.\n3. We then loop over each non-empty connected component in the bottom-right triangle that we found in step 2, and recursively merge pairs until there are at least 3 elements in the component. We increment `count` by 2 whenever we find a connected component with an even number of cells, and add the first element of the component to `v`. We remove the last element of the `c` list and add the smallest element among the merged sorted elements to `v`. Finally, we extract the leftmost value of the component and append it to the `c` list.\n4. We return the `v` array.\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^3 log n), because we perform a worst-case number of iterations in step 2 and 3. However, we can optimize this by using a Segment Tree to maintain the list of connected components, so the time complexity can be reduced to O(n^2 log n).\n\nOverall, this algorithm is a good solution to the problem, and should be able to solve it efficiently for any input `n`."], "idxs": [195], "new_tokens": [641], "wall_time": [9.573024272918701]}], "tstamp": 1734539910.6590137}

While these laws are a good starting point for considering ethical issues related to AI, there are many other ethical considerations that are important when designing and using AI systems, such as privacy, data protection, and accountability.

This can help doctors make more timely and accurate diagnoses, leading to better patient outcomes.\n\nAnother benefit of AI in healthcare is its ability to help patients manage their conditions more effectively. For example, AI-powered apps can help patients track their symptoms, monitor their vital signs, and receive personalized recommendations for managing their conditions. This can help improve patient outcomes by providing more tailored and timely care.\n\nAI can also help healthcare providers manage their workflows more effectively and efficiently. For example, AI-powered chatbots can help triage patients, automate routine tasks such as filling prescriptions or scheduling appointments, and provide real-time insights into patient data, such as their vital signs or lab results. This can free up healthcare providers to focus on high-touch care, such as consultations with patients, while still providing timely and effective care.\n\nFinally, AI can help reduce healthcare costs by identifying inefficiencies and areas for improvement. For example, AI-powered analytics tools can help hospitals identify the most common reasons for readmissions and the factors that are associated with higher healthcare costs. This can help hospitals identify areas where they can improve patient outcomes and reduce costs, improving overall healthcare quality and efficiency.\n\nOverall, AI has the potential to bring significant benefits to the healthcare sector, including improved accuracy and speed of diagnoses, better management of chronic conditions, improved workflow management, and improved healthcare quality and efficiency."], "idxs": [117], "new_tokens": [427], "wall_time": [5.777243375778198]}], "tstamp": 1734539952.6032002}

Here are some tips to help you keep your rose plant healthy and thriving:\n\n1. Watering: Roses require regular watering, but it's important not to over-water them. Water the soil around the base of the plant to a depth of at least 1-2 inches. Watering deeply but infrequently is better than frequent shallow watering, which can lead to root rot. It's also important to let the soil dry out between waterings, but don't let it get bone dry.\n2. Fertilizing: Roses benefit from a balanced fertilizer, such as one that contains equal parts nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Apply the fertilizer in early spring, again in late spring, and once more in early summer. Follow the instructions on the package for the appropriate application rate.\n3. Pruning: Prune roses in late winter or early spring to remove any dead or damaged canes and to shape the plant. Remove any crossing or rubbing branches, and trim back any long canes to a height of 18-36 inches. This will improve the overall health and appearance of your rose plant.\n4. Fungus and pests: Keep your rose plant healthy by monitoring it for any signs of disease or pest infestation. Remove any affected leaves, branches, or flowers as soon as possible to prevent the spread of pests and diseases. You can also use natural pest control methods, such as introducing beneficial insects or using neem oil, to keep your rose plant healthy and pest-free.\n5.

They have been around for centuries and have traditionally been the primary source of news for many people.\n\nAdvantages of print media:\n\n1. High credibility and trustworthiness - Print media have a long history of reporting accurate and unbiased news, which has led to a high level of credibility among readers.\n2. Integration of visuals - Print media are able to incorporate high-quality images, images, and graphics, which makes the content more engaging and informative.\n3. Limited competition - Traditional print media has less competition from digital media, which allows them to maintain a loyal readership.\n\nDISADVANTAGES OF PRINT MEDIA\n\n1. Limited reach - Print media have a limited reach compared to digital media, which means they are not able to reach as many people.\n2. Costly production - Print media production is expensive, which makes it difficult for new publishers to enter the market.\n3. Declining readership - The number of people reading print media has been declining in recent years due to the rise of digital media.\n\nDIGITAL MEDIA\n\nDigital media refers to media content that is delivered through digital channels such as websites, social media, and apps. This includes news websites, blogs, and video content.\n\nAdvantages of digital media:\n\n1. Increased reach - Digital media reach a wider audience and can be accessed from anywhere in the world.\n2. Interactivity - Digital media allows for real-time interaction with readers, which makes it easier for publishers to engage with their audience and gather feedback.\n3. Cost-effective - Digital media costs are significantly lower than traditional print media, making it easier for new publishers to enter the market.\n\nDISADVANTAGES OF DIGITAL MEDIA\n\n1. Short attention span - Audiences are prone to short attention spans, which makes it difficult for digital media to keep readers engaged.\n2. Easy to find false information - Digital media can be easily manipulated and spread false information, which can be misleading to readers.\n3. Struggling business model - Digital media's business model is struggling, which has led to a decline in quality of some publications.\n\nIn conclusion, both print and digital media have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them largely depends on the target audience, budget, and goals of the publisher. While print media remain relevant for people who prefer traditional media and long-form content, digital media offer a more flexible, interactive, and cost-effective option for reaching a wider audience."], "idxs": [179], "new_tokens": [600], "wall_time": [8.79548954963684]}], "tstamp": 1734540012.0026445}

The problem with open-ended generation is that there is no fixed length or structure for the summary, so the algorithm must be able to generate the summary in a way that is appropriate for the specific document.\n\nTo tackle this problem, researchers used supervised machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) etc. The data is commonly represented in terms of Bag of Words or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and the summary is made by ranking the words in the document based on their relevance to the overall topic.\n\nText summarization also has additional challenges such as the presence of stop words, misspellings, and the large number of data available. To handle these challenges, researchers have implemented various techniques such as removing stop words, stemming and lemmatization, and using language models.
