If it does, it recursively calls `reverse_delete` on `s[1:]` (the part of `s` after the first character) and `c`, and concatenates the result with the first character of `s`. It then returns the result string and False, since a palindrome can be represented as either string.\n* If `s` is not a palindrome, it returns a string that represents the position of the first character in `c` that matches `s`. This string is the reversed copy of `c` minus the characters that match `s` from the beginning and the end of `c`. This string must be False, since it doesn't represent a palindrome.\n\nI hope this helps!

The current element is a 2-digit decimal number, so its first significant digit is located at the index `.` of the string representation of the number. So, we can retrieve the first significant digit of `arr[i]` by calling the `index` method with the string `.` and passing in the current element `arr[i]` as an argument. Then we can retrieve the number of significant digits in the number by calling the `count` method (with `str()`) and passing in the current element `arr[i]` as an argument. The `abs` function is used to get the absolute value of the count of significant digits in the number so that we can properly handle negative numbers.\n* If `arr[i]` is not greater than or equal to 0, then the current element is negative. In this case, we can simply subtract the absolute value of the count of significant digits from the current element and assign the result to a new variable `arr[i]`. We use the `abs` function to get the absolute value of the count of significant digits so that we can properly handle negative numbers.\n* After the loop finishes, we return the overall count of elements in `arr` with a sum of digits greater than 0.\n\nHere's an example of how you can test the function:\n```python\nprint(count_nums([]) == 0) # should evaluate to True\nprint(count_nums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1) # should evaluate to True\nprint(count_nums([1, 1, 2]) == 3) # should evaluate to True\n```"], "idxs": [159], "new_tokens": [632], "wall_time": [7.897614479064941]}], "tstamp": 1734539589.430917}

Then we initialize an empty dictionary to store the results.\n\nWe define the `count_sorted` function that sorts the integers in non-decreasing order and count how many times each integer appears. After iterating over all the integers, the `count_sorted` function returns the minimum count, which corresponds to the minimum sum of a non-empty sub-array.\n\nThen we iterate over each key in `count_sorted(nums)` and build a sub-array for that key, starting from the first integer in the set. We keep moving forward in the list while the next integer is less than or equal to the previous one, and remove the previous integers from the set.\n\nFinally, we store the sum of the sub-array in the dictionary, keyed to the integer that the sub-array is a subset of. We return the minimum sum among all the keys.\n\nHere's how you could test this implementation:\n```csharp\nprint(minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]))  # prints 1\nprint(minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]))  # prints -6\n```"], "idxs": [145], "new_tokens": [545], "wall_time": [7.1938323974609375]}], "tstamp": 1734539662.5217693}
