Even though Mayall suffered from epilepsy and almost died in a quad bike accident, he did not update his will after the accident. Mayall's personal estate would be divided according to Government intestacy rules, which take into account marital status and children. Mayall's children may inherit an amount liable for inheritance tax if the amount is more than the inheritance tax limit of \u00a3325,000. Mayall's widow would have received a life interest in the remaining half, meaning she could not touch or transfer that money but could claim interest on it. Mayall's family could seek to avoid the tax by drawing up a deed of variation to split up his estate, reducing any sum left to the children so it was below the tax threshold. Mayall's writing partner, Laurence Marks, also lived in the Oxfordshire constituency of Witney, where David Cameron became MP in 1997. Marks had become a local celebrity due to the success of The New Statesman. Marks and his partner Maurice Gran were introduced to all five candidates for the Witney seat at the 2001 general election, and they plumped for an ambitious young man called David Cameron, who won the seat with a majority of nearly 8,000.
