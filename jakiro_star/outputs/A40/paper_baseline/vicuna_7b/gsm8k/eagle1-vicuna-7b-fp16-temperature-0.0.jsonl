However, we can use the concept of complementary probabilities to estimate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row and the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.\n\nThe probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3/6, or 50%. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is also 50%.\n\nThe probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/6, or 17%. Therefore, the probability of not rolling a number greater than 3 is 100% - 17% = 83%.\n\nWe can use the complementary probability formula to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:\n\nP(rolling a number greater than 3) = 1 - P(not rolling a number greater than 3)\n\nP(rolling a number greater than 3) = 1 - 83% = 17%\n\nTherefore, it is 17% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."], "idxs": [63], "new_tokens": [266], "wall_time": [2.8790528774261475]}], "tstamp": 1734539546.3680232}
