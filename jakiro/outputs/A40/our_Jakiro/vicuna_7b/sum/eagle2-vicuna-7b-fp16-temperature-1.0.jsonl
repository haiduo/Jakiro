They believe that the oilfield holds 158 million barrels per square mile, equating to 100 billion barrels across the basin. The site is situated near Gatwick Airport and test drilling is currently underway. The British Geological Survey has estimated the basin holds just 4.4 billion barrels of shale oil, while a study by Imperial College London suggests a maximum of 40 billion barrels. The exploration is expected to create many thousands of jobs and could potentially reduce reliance on oil from the Middle East and Russia. However, industry experts remain skeptical of the claims and one described them as \"overly optimistic.\" Profits from the oil will go to the Government, who owns the land under the homes of residents. The government will receive taxes on the oil extracted and may grant oil companies licenses to excavate oil and keep profits. Oil companies do not have to pay surface landowners unless they want to base their drilling site on the land. Fracking is a more intrusive method of extracting oil, and if it is used, the companies must agree to provide \"community benefits\" which includes building a playground or school, and is seen as compensation for residents.
