The shape of the ellipse is almost an ellipse, a slightly flattened circle. The Earth's elliptical orbit has a longer semi-major axis (the longer part of the ellipse) than a semi-minor axis (the shorter part). This means that the distance between the Earth and the Sun varies throughout the orbit.\n\nThe closest the Earth gets to the Sun is called \"perihelion,\" and it happens about 3 million miles (4.8 million kilometers) closer to the Sun than the farthest point, which is called \"aphelion.\" The reason the distance to the Sun varies has to do with the fact that the Earth is traveling around the Sun on an inclined axis. This means that the Sun appears to move North and South, with the Sun appearing higher in the sky in the summer than in the winter.\n\nThe fact that the Earth's orbit is not a perfect circle also has some effects on the seasons. For example, in the Northern Hemisphere, the winter solstice (the day when the Sun is at its lowest point in the sky) occurs when the Earth is tilted away from the Sun, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere, the winter solstice occurs when the Earth is tilted towards the Sun.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that the Earth's orbit is not the only factor that determines the weather.

However, the berries of Louisiana mistletoe are exceptionally sweet, which attracts a specific type of beetle known as the mistletoe beetle. The beetles mate with the female mistletoe plants, but instead of laying eggs in the plant, they lay their eggs on the branches of other trees in the swamp. When the eggs hatch, the larvae establish themselves in the bark of the tree and begin to feed, eventually killing the tree.\n\nAs a result of this unusual method of reproduction, Louisiana mistletoe populations grow rapidly and can completely engulf whole trees over a period of just a few years.\n\nAdditionally, the bayous in Louisiana are typically home to a variety of wildlife, including birds, alligators, and snakes.
