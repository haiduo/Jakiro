However, we can use the concept of complementary probabilities to estimate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row and the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.\n\nThe probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3/6, or 50%. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is also 50%.\n\nThe probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/6, or 17.7%. To find the complement of this event, we need to find the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3. Since there are two numbers less than 3 (2 and 3), the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 is 2/6, or 33.3%. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1 - 33.3% = 66.7%, which is approximately 67%.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is about 67%, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is also 50%.
