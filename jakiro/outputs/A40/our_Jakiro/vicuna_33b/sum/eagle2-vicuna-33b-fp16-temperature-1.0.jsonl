Mayall, who suffered head injuries in a 1998 quad-bike accident and later developed epilepsy, passed away last June at the age of 56. Probate records reveal that he had no will, which could result in complications for his wife of 29 years, Barbara, and their three adult children.\n\nExperts have always advised people to have a valid will to avoid tax pitfalls. Mayall's estate could be liable for tax amounting to tens of thousands of pounds, which would not have been payable if he had left everything to his wife. Under the rules of intestacy, the division of Mayall's net estate of \u00a31,192,701 after funeral and legal expenses is as follows: his wife would receive \u00a3250,000 plus all his \"chattels\" (personal belongings), and their children would automatically inherit a share of the remaining value of the estate, potentially leading to an inheritance tax bill if the amount exceeds the threshold of \u00a3325,000.\n\nTo avoid the tax, Mayall's family could draft a deed of variation to split up his estate, reducing any sum left to the children so it is below the tax threshold. Mayall's widow declined to discuss the estate and the apparent lack of a will, stating that she had not yet heard from her lawyers.\n\nIt was revealed that the writing team behind Alan B'Stard, Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran, also played a significant role in helping David Cameron into No. 10.

When babies were presented with a ball that seemed to pass through a solid wall or a toy car that floated in the air, they reacted with surprise and tried to understand the phenomenon by banging the ball on a table or dropping the car.\n\nAnother study found that infants are capable of understanding complex social situations, such as bullying and friendship, at just 13 months old. These findings suggest that babies have strong feelings about how people should interact and can distinguish between different social situations.\n\nResearchers also discovered that babies are more likely to learn from surprises, as they use these experiences to form new predictions about the world. This innate curiosity helps babies learn more effectively, even at a young age.\n\nFurther studies have shown that babies have a remarkable understanding of math and physics, which may be due to some information being so fundamental to survival that we are born with it.

The company is conducting an investigation to determine the exact cause of the contamination. Ten recalled products earlier in March were from a production line at the company's headquarters in Brenham, Texas. The now-recalled ice cream product, available in bulk to institutional accounts like hospitals in 23 states, is not sold in retail locations. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises consumers not to eat any Blue Bell brand products made at the Oklahoma facility and asks retailers and institutions not to sell or serve them. The recall began after five patients at a Wichita, Kansas, hospital became ill with listeriosis while hospitalized between December 2013 and January 2015. Officials determined that at least four of the patients drank milkshakes containing Blue Bell ice cream, with three of them later dying. Listeriosis, a life-threatening infection, is caused by eating food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. The disease primarily affects pregnant women, newborns, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. The CDC identified six patients with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 that was indistinguishable from the ice cream product traced to the Oklahoma plant. Four of these patients were hospitalized in Texas for unrelated issues before developing listeriosis, with one patient reportedly eating ice cream in a Texas hospital before becoming ill. Blue Bell will conduct a thorough examination of its Oklahoma plant to identify the cause of contamination and ensure improvements are made before resuming operations.
