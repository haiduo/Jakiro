Next, we need to find the time it takes James to swim 12 miles at 2 miles per hour. We'll use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Rate\nTime = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours\n3. After swimming 12 miles, James stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time. Since he rested half as long, we'll reduce the 6 hours by half:\n\nRest time = 6 hours \\* 0.5 = 3 hours\n4. Now, we need to find out how far James swims at half the speed. James will swim the remaining distance (20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles) at 1 mile per hour (half of 2 miles per hour). We'll use the formula:\n\nDistance = Rate \\* Time\nDistance = 1 mile per hour \\* Time = 8 miles \\* Time\n\nSince we don't know the time it takes James to swim the remaining distance, we can't solve for Time directly. However, we do know that the total time it took him to cross the lake includes both swimming and resting.\n\nTotal time = Swimming time + Resting time\nTotal time = 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours\n\nNow we can find the time it takes James to swim the remaining distance:\n\n9 hours = 6 hours (swimming at 2 miles per hour) + (Time \\* 2 miles per hour)\n\nWe can now solve for Time:\n\nTime = 9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours\n\nSince James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, we need to double the time:\n\nTime \\* 2 = 6 hours\n\nThis gives us:\n\n6 hours = 3 hours \\* 2 = 6 hours\n\nThis is a contradiction, so there must be a mistake in"], "idxs": [119], "new_tokens": [514], "wall_time": [19.678452968597412]}], "tstamp": 1737715497.1912248}
