If a set has a skewed distribution, such as when the tail is heavily weighted (as in extreme values), the arithmetic mean can be misleading. In such cases, other measures of central tendency, such as the median, mode, or geometric mean, may be more appropriate.\n\nThe arithmetic mean is commonly used in statistics and has many practical applications.

If you're studying in a noisy environment, consider using noise-cancelling headphones or earplugs to block out distracting sounds.\n2. Schedule study breaks: Take short breaks during your study sessions to give your brain a rest and avoid burnout. This can help keep you focused and motivated during your study time.\n3. Avoid multitasking: Focusing on multiple tasks at once can decrease productivity and increase distractions. Instead, try to focus on one task at a time, and complete it before moving on to another task.\n4. Limit electronic screens: Turn off or disable notifications on your electronic devices to minimize distractions. If you need to use electronic devices for studying, consider using them only for specific tasks and avoid browsing social media or checking emails during study time.\n5. Use study aids: Consider using study aids like flashcards, highlighters, or note-taking systems to help you focus on the material you're studying. These tools can help you stay engaged and avoid distractions.\n6. Set a timer: Use a timer to set specific study intervals, and take a short break when the timer goes off.

The `^` character matches the start of the string, and the `[a-zA-Z]` matches any letter. Therefore, `[^a-zA-Z]` matches any character that is not a letter.\n\nWe then call the `replace` method on the input string `str` using the `regExp` regular expression, and replace all matched non-letter characters with an empty string `\"\"`. This effectively removes all non-letter characters from the input string.\n\nFinally, we return the filtered string `result`.\n\nWe demonstrate the usage of the `removeNonLetterCharacters` function by passing the string \"Hello, World!\" and calling the function, and then logging the result to the console.

Fertilize the soil regularly: Use a rose-specific fertilizer and apply it according to the instructions on the label.\n5. Prune the plant regularly: Pruning is important to promote healthy growth, remove dead or damaged wood, and shape the plant. You can prune roses in spring or fall, or in early summer if you're looking to increase the number of flowers.\n6. Protect the plant from pests and diseases: Watch for signs of pests or diseases, and take action as needed. Use insecticides and fungicides according to the instructions on the label.\n7. Remove weeds and debris: Keep the area around the plant free of weeds and debris to prevent Competition for the rose and to keep the area clean.\n8.

This includes newspapers, magazines, and books. Print media has been around for centuries and has played a significant role in shaping societies and cultures around the world. Here are some key characteristics of print media:\n\n1. Tangible: Print media is physical, which gives it a tangible quality that cannot be replicated by digital media. Readers can touch, feel, and hold the physical copy of a newspaper or magazine.\n2. Wide reach: Newspapers and magazines have a wide distribution network, which allows them to reach a large audience regardless of location or time. This makes them an effective way to deliver breaking news and local stories.\n3. Long-form content: Print media is well-suited for in-depth reporting and long-form content, which allows readers to delve into a subject matter in greater detail.\n\nDIGITAL MEDIA:\nDigital media refers to media that is delivered through electronic means, such as computers, smartphones, and tablets. This includes websites, social media, blogs, and online forums. Digital media has gained prominence in recent years and has revolutionized the way people consume news and information. Here are some key characteristics of digital media:\n\n1. Convenient: Digital media is highly convenient as it can be accessed from anywhere at any time. This makes it easier for people to stay informed about current events and trends.\n2. Real-time updates: Digital media allows for real-time updates, which means stories can be shared and updated as they happen. This is particularly useful for breaking news and events.\n3. Interactive: Digital media is highly interactive, with readers able to engage with content through commenting, feedback, and sharing. This allows for a two-way dialogue between the media and its audience.\n\nIn conclusion, both print and digital media have their own unique advantages and disadvantages. Print media provides a tangible experience and is well-suited for in-depth reporting, while digital media is convenient, real-time, and highly interactive.

Two-factor authentication: This method adds an additional layer of security to password-based authentication by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, such as a one-time password sent to their mobile phone, a fingerprint scan, or a digital certificate. This makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access to the system or application, even if they have obtained the password.\n3. Biometric authentication: This method uses unique physical characteristics, such as a fingerprint, facial recognition, or voice recognition, to authenticate a user. This method is considered more secure than password-based authentication as it is difficult to mimic or steal these physical characteristics. Biometric authentication is commonly used in smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices to ensure that only the authorized user can access the device.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many authentication methods available.
