Research conducted at the University of Missouri found that 11-month-olds are capable of understanding complex social situations, such as bullying, friendship, and being a bystander. The study showed that when babies were shown a ball disappearing through a wall and then given the ball to play with, they attempted to work out its secret by banging it on a table. Even more surprising, after seeing a magic trick where a ball appeared to go through a solid wall, they repeated the trick by trying to drop a toy car through the wall.\n\nThese findings are fascinating because they suggest that babies have a natural curiosity and desire to learn, even from seemingly impossible situations. Surprisingly, the babies in the study were more interested in playing with the ball than a brand new toy they had never seen before. This highlights the idea that babies learn best when they are surprised, and it suggests that they use their existing knowledge to form predictions, and when those predictions are shown to be wrong, they use it as an opportunity to learn more. \"When babies are surprised, they learn much better, as though they are taking the occasion to try to figure something out about their world,\" says Lisa Feigerson, a professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\n\nFurthermore, research has shown that babies are born with innate knowledge of math and physics, including the understanding that objects cannot pass through solid walls. Aimee Stahl, the lead author of the study, believes that young babies are \"remarkably sophisticated thinkers\" and that they use their core knowledge to empower new learning.
