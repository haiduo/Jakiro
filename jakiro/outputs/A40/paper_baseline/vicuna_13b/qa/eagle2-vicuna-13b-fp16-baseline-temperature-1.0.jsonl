Over time, the pinata evolved from its religious origins and became a popular entertainment for children's parties.\n\nThe traditional pinata is made of paper mache or clay, shaped like animals, mythical creatures, or other objects, and is filled with sweets and small toys. The person trying to break the pinata uses a blindfold and a stick, and the breaking of the pinata is often accompanied by singing, music, and cheering.\n\nIn Mexico, the pinata is considered a symbol of good luck and a way to celebrate the upcoming harvest season, as well as to commemorate the Day of the Dead. The pinata has become an integral part of Mexican culture and is celebrated at parties and festivals throughout the country.\n\nIn summary, the tradition of the pinata has its roots in both European and Latin American cultures, with origins in religious and cultural celebrations, and has evolved over time into the popular entertainment for children's parties that we know today."], "idxs": [364], "new_tokens": [0], "wall_time": [19.655202865600586]}], "tstamp": 1734501289.6861935}
