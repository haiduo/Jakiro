The UK is beefing up defences on the Falkland Islands, responding to the perceived threat from Russia amongst other factors, and will modernise its defences with new equipment and infrastructure. The UK's Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon, announced last week that two Chinook helicopters and an upgraded surface-to-air missile system will be part of the new package of defence measures for the Falkland Islands. President Kirchner's recent comments represent Argentine government's legal action against three British and two US companies for exploration activities for fossil fuels on the Argentine continental shelf without obtaining the corresponding authorisation and warning the rig's owner, Greece-based firm Ocean Rig, that it could face 'legal consequences' over the drilling. The legal complaint accused Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration, Falkland Oil and Gas Limited and Noble Energy and Edison International of sending a semi-submersible rig to explore a basin 120 miles north of the islands 'subjected to the illegitimate British occupation' and the defence secretary summoned the Argentinian ambassador to London last week to account for the recent statements made by President Kirchner and the Argentine government.

Now, researchers have found that passive smoking affects plants too, which can take up nicotine from contaminated soil and plumes of smoke. This finding explains why some spices, herbal teas, and medicinal plants have high concentrations of nicotine in them, despite none being allowed in insecticides. The study, published in Springer's journal Agronomy for Sustainable Development, suggests that reported high levels of nicotine in these substances may originate from tobacco. The researchers found that when peppermint plants were mulched with cigarette tobacco for more than nine days, the resulting nicotine concentrations in them were several times higher than the maximum residue level set by European authorities. The researchers also showed that cats and dogs whose owners smoke are twice as likely to develop some types of cancer as those whose owners do not. Dogs that are exposed to tobacco smoke are much more likely to develop nose and lung cancers than dogs not exposed to smoke. Previous research found that cats that live with smokers are twice as likely to develop Feline Lymphoma, a serious cancer of the blood and immune system. The study suggests that substances such as alkaloids can be transferred from one plant to another after its death, such as through horizontal transfer of natural products.
