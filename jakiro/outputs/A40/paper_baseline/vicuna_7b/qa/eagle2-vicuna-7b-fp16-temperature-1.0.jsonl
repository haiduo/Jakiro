These earthenware pots were then decorated with religious scenes and then suspended from the ceiling or placed on the ground, and the children were encouraged to use sticks or their fists to break the pot open and release the contents.\n\nThe use of a pinata spread popularity to Aztec and Mayan cultures where they used clay pots as well.

This aspect is particularly relevant in the case of editioned prints or serigraphs, which are often produced in small or large quantities and offered at lower prices.\n2. Small to large scale: Printmaking techniques can be adapted to produce both small and large-scale works, allowing artists to create elaborate, intricate compositions as well as more subtle and delicate images.\n3. Unique and varied techniques: Printmaking is a medium that encompasses a variety of techniques, each with its own distinct characteristics, such as woodcuts, lithographs, screenprints, etchings, engravings, and more. This diverse range of techniques offers artists the opportunity to experiment with different effects, textures, and styles.\n4. Collaboration: Printmaking processes often involve collaboration between the artist and a skilled printmaker or collaborators, enabling the exploration of different creative directions and techniques, adding another dimension to the creative process.\n5. Accessible medium: Printmaking techniques are generally more accessible to artists with limited training in traditional art forms, since many of the processes are less forgiving and require less technical skill than, for example, painting or sculpture. This accessibility has led to a proliferation of printmakers and a rich diversity of styles and themes in the field of contemporary printmaking.\n6.

In 2020, Singapore's largest hydroelectric power plant, the Singapore mainland's first large-scale power project, began operations at the Brompton Water Basin. The plant has an installed capacity of 37.5 megawatts (MW) and will provide a significant portion of the power required to support the growth and development of Jurong Island, a key industrial hub in Singapore.\n\nIn addition to the Brompton Water Basin, Singapore has also identified several other sites for potential hydroelectric power development, including the Serangoon River and the Kallang River.
