The total number of days can be calculated by subtracting his birthday from the end of the year (December 31st):\n```\nTotal number of days = 365 (days in a year) - 71 (days from December 31st to July 19th) = 294\n```\nThen, to calculate the total number of calories that Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, you can use the following formula:\n```\nTotal number of calories needed to be burned = Total number of days * daily calorie deficit\n```\nIn this case, the daily calorie deficit needed is 3500 calories / 294 days = 120 calories per day.\n\nTherefore, to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday on July 19th, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of 120 calories from his current calorie intake. He should aim to consume 120 calories fewer each day than his recommended daily calorie intake for weight loss, or 1200 calories per day for women, or 1500 calories per day for men. This calorie deficit will result in a weight loss of around 1 pound per week, so in this case, it would take about 7 weeks to reach the goal of losing 30 lbs. by the end of July.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that this is just an estimate and that individual weight loss results may vary based on various factors such as age, sex, starting weight, and current calorie intake."], "idxs": [465], "new_tokens": [0], "wall_time": [14.039307117462158]}], "tstamp": 1734496042.363936}
