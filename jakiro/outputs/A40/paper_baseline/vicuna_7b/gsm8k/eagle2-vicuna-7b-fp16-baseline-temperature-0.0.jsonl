However, we can use the concept of complementary probabilities to estimate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row and the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.\n\nThe probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3/6, or 50%. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is also 50%.\n\nThe probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/6, or 17%. Therefore, the probability of not rolling a number greater than 3 is 100% - 17% = 83%.\n\nWe can use the complementary probability formula to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:\n\nP(rolling a number greater than 3) = 1 - P(rolling two even numbers in a row)\n\nSubstituting the values we found, we get:\n\nP(rolling a number greater than 3) = 1 - 50% = 50%\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%, while the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is also 50%.\n\nWe cannot determine the exact percentage difference between these two probabilities, but we can say that they are both 50%."], "idxs": [307], "new_tokens": [0], "wall_time": [9.26967716217041]}], "tstamp": 1734495897.3811793}
