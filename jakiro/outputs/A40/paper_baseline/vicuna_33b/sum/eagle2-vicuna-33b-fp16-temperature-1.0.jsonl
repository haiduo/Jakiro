Experts recommend that individuals have a valid will to avoid such tax pitfalls.\n\nMayall's children could inherit a sum that would be liable for inheritance tax, depending on the value of his chattels, or personal belongings. His wife, Barbara, would receive \u00a3250,000 and all his chattels under intestacy rules. The family could potentially avoid the tax by setting up a deed of variation to split up the estate and reduce any sum left to the children below the tax threshold.\n\nInterestingly, Mayall's friends and colleagues, Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran, who were the writers behind \"The New Statesman,\" had a role in David Cameron's rise to power. They lived in the Oxfordshire constituency of Witney, where Cameron would later become MP. They advised against selecting Shaun Woodward as the Conservative candidate for Witney in 1997, but their opinion was more respected when they endorsed David Cameron as the candidate in 2001.
