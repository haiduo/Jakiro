Mayall's failure to leave a will means his estate will be divided according to Government intestacy rules, which take into account his marital status and children. His children could inherit an amount liable for inheritance tax, depending on the value of his chattels or personal belongings. However, the family could seek a deed of variation to split up his estate and reduce any sum left to the children below the tax threshold.\n\nMeanwhile, Rik Mayall's involvement in a 1990s sitcom has an unexpected connection to former UK Prime Minister David Cameron. Writer Laurence Marks, who created the satirical show The New Statesman, lived in the Oxfordshire constituency of Witney, where Cameron would later become MP. Marks, a committed Labour supporter, and his writing partner had become local celebrities due to the success of the show. Although they did not support him, their views on who should contest the seat for the Tories at the 1997 General Election were taken into account. Their advice was followed in 2001 when they supported David Cameron, who went on to become Prime Minister.
